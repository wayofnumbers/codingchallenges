    "Make good use of the filters on the right side. \n",
    "- **Easy** - basic syntaxes mastery and best practises.\n",
    "- **Medium** - putting multiple pieces together\n",
    "- **Hard** - putting everything thing together, adding time/spae limit. Some hard problems you can't brute force.  "

    "### Tip #2: Record, Reapply, Repeat\n",
    "- **Record** your success and failures. Anylize the problem. What it is trying to test you? What techniques are used? Is your solution the optimum? What is the most upvoted solution in the `Discussion` section? Why?\n",
    "- **Reapply** what you've just recorded and learned to new challenges to make it your second nature. That's the benefit of steam-roller through all challenges in a relatively short period of time.\n",
    "- **Repeat** step 1 and 2. You will find yourself learning new things while practicing them. Spotting more patterns and adding the optimum solutions to them. In short, you are growing fast."

    "The discussion section probably is the most valuable part of Hackerrank. I learned so much from it. But it has a tendency to upvote those 'sexy' one-liners, don't get obbsesed! Readability still trumps one-liners everyday in real world.\n"
